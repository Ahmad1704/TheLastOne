1. `WaveManager` spawns enemies â†’ enemies use `Health` â†’ on death â†’ notify `UIManager` and pool back.
2. Player uses `WeaponHandler` â†’ calls `AmmoManager` & spawns bullets â†’ bullets damage `IDamageable`.
3. `CameraManager` switches perspectives dynamically.
4. `UIManager` listens to all major events and updates UI accordingly.
